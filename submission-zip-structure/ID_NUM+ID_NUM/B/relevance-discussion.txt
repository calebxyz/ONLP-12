In the BIGRAM Transition matrix we have 292 transitions (including "START") out of all the 306 possible,
not much of a different from the worst case in which every transition is possible.
292^2/306^2=85264/93636=9% difference

So the worst case is relevant measure in the case of the transition matrix.
